# Alzheimer-s-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

This project will help in the research of Alzheimer's Disease, such as, what happens in the early
stages and what triggers the disease. In this way doctors will be able to understand what sort of
substances will treat patients and the pharmaceuticals can manufacture medicines according to
that. In our model, we will be using a deep learning based model for higher accuracy rate. The
proposed model is based on pre - trained models. The improvements in computational
efficiency, availability of large data sets of labeled and classified data makes classification and
prediction problems efficient. This project is an attempt to classify the diseased and normal
individuals and predict Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Classification and prediction were the two major
computational tasks in this problem.
