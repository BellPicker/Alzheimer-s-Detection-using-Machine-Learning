# Alzheimer-s-Detection-using-Machine-Learning

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that worsens over time.
Though it is best known for its role in declining memory function, other symptoms include difficulty thinking and reasoning, making judgments and decisions, and planning and performing familiar tasks. It may also cause personality and behavioral changes. The cause of Alzheimer's disease is unknown. It is thought that there is a significant hereditary component. 

# Project-Motivation
This project is dedicated to classification of the data and prediction of accurate detection of Alzheimer's. In our model, we will be using a deep learning based model for higher accuracy rate. The proposed model is based on pre - trained models. The improvements in computational
efficiency, availability of large data sets of labeled and classified data makes classification and prediction problems efficient. This project is an attempt to classify the diseased and normal individuals and predict Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Classification and prediction were the two major computational tasks in this problem.
